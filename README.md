# LED Matrix Tester
### [Live Demo](https://adamnizol.github.io/ledmatrixtester/)

To interface with a Bluetooth LED matrix I needed to work out and test the data format that it uses. This web app allows me to easily test it out and demonstrate it to others that are trying to work with the same type of matrix.
